# LendInvest Technical Test

My attempt at the technical test for LendInvest.

To run, clone the repo, use `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

Note:
- There are currently no tests on this repo (an FDD approach was taken due to time limitations)
- There is no flux implementation added nor server/persistence of data - no need to complicate it just yet
- I've made a few assumptions about the values in the example data given, particularly about what the values for 'amount' and 'available' represent, might be incorrect but its an interpretation which can easily be fixed with guidance


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
